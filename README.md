## Social Network Graph Tutorial
Every social network platform is an example of graph theory being applied to solve the problem of finding connections â€“ and recommending appropriate ones.

In this tutorial, I'll build a graph of my nine closest friends and use graph theory to figure out interesting data about them.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this tutorial, I will be able to...

1. Implement a graph in code.
1. Use a variety of neighbor lookup algorithms for a given graph
1. Traverse a graph through various search methods
